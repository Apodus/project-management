/**
 * The responder loop (Campaign C3 P1 — skeleton + claim, NO spawn).
 *
 * Per watched project, each tick:
 *   1. GET open escalations (a per-project error → warn + continue; the loop
 *      survives and recovers next tick).
 *   2. Filter to the SEED set: an escalation is a candidate iff
 *        holderId == null            (unclaimed — no live worker owns it)
 *        && authorId !== selfId      (NO-RECURSION: never answer our own thread)
 *        && status === "open"
 *        && !claimed.has(id)          (we haven't already claimed it this process)
 *   3. Oldest-first by createdAt. For each, under a `maxConcurrent` semaphore,
 *      acknowledge(id) to CLAIM it (the C1 one-active-responder gate).
 *        - success → record claimed, log "claimed … (stays acknowledged until
 *          P3 adds answer)". (P2 will spawn the answering session here.)
 *        - 403 → another responder beat us; skip silently (debug), don't record.
 *        - 409 → raced out of open (resolved/answered between list and ack); skip.
 *        - other → warn, leave un-claimed so a later tick retries.
 *
 * `enabled` is the kill-switch: a disabled tick is a no-op (defense-in-depth —
 * index.ts also exits before entering the loop). `mode` is NOT consulted here in
 * P1 (parsed-only; the loop always claims when enabled — see config.ts).
